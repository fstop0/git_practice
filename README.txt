Hello Git its me, fstop0

My name is Michael Lagerman, I am an artist, educator, and programmer. 

I create photos, videos, and installations that evoke the viewers participation in physical perception and queer space. 

I work as an educator in photography and design. My pedagogy structures an illusory scaffold that prefers interdisciplinary thinking, encourages experimentation and embraces entropy in a diverse and inclusive classroom/lab.

I program in various modes of meaning. First I have been programming through acts of curation since 2017. I program and contribute to hosting/producing and public events. I maintain the project space and screening room, Underscore in Milwaukee, WI. This space is developing to fill a needed space for anti-institutional experimentation in our city. 

I also program in the sense that I am learning computer programming. My palate for languages is broad but many are underdeveloped. Taking on learning languages and syntax I hope to focus my portfolio towards experimental typography, educational praxis, and human focused interaction experience.
